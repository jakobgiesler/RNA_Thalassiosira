# RNA_Thalassiosira

# SNP_Analysis_T.rotula.R contains 3 steps to analyse SNPs of multiple strains of T. rotula:
  1.Create presence-absence matrix of all contigs across all strains
  2.SNP Analysis across all strains
  3.SNP Analysis of BUSCO genes across all strains
  
# Prerequisites:
  1. Files with counts for the contigs for each strain separately (paired, trimmed, mapped, locally realligned)
  2. SNP files (i.e. Low frequency detection files)
  3. Table of BUSCO genes
